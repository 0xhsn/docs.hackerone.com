You can remove a custom inbox if you no longer need it.

><i>Tip: Bear in mind that removing an inbox will revoke access to the reports for the groups that had access before.</i>

You can remove an inbox from two places:

1. Select Remove inbox from the action picker in the inbox overview, or
2. Select the inbox you want to remove by clicking on the inbox link in the inbox overview and selecting the delete icon.

Both options will prompt you to review the impacts of deleting a custom inbox.<br />
Remove the inbox by clicking **Remove inbox** in the modal.

Removing an inbox will:
* Remove access for groups that had access to the inbox
* Remove the Inbox tag from reports that were allocated to that inbox (you will not be able to filter on this inbox anymore)

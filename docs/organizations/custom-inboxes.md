Custom inboxes allow you to separate report access based on your teams, assets, or business units. Organization administrators can create additional inboxes to support their organization structures and workflow needs.

As custom inboxes are not connected to an engagement, they can provide access to a subset of reports without granting access to the engagements themselves.

><i>Custom inboxes are available to Enterprise customers only.</i>

Welcome to HackerOne Pentest Documentation and Delivery Guide!

The purpose of this guide is to lay out the processes, tools, and instructions that both our internal teams and the wider pentester community employ during the delivery of successful pentest engagements.

This document outlines the various pentester and technical team's roles and responsibilities, provides insight into the selection and onboarding process, explains our testing methodology, details the communication channels, and presents the guidelines we advocate for when documenting vulnerabilities identified throughout each pentest.

The guide concludes with a [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](/organizations/pentest-faqs.html) section to address common queries and ensure a comprehensive understanding of our approach.

At HackerOne, we've redefined [traditional pentesting](https://www.hackerone.com/penetration-testing/youre-doing-pentesting-wrong) with our Pentest as a Service (PTaaS) delivery model, providing heavily-vetted domain expertise, swift results, and interactive feedback. This approach not only guarantees regulatory compliance but also fosters direct engagement and teamwork between security teams and pentesters throughout each project.

PTaaS approach is not just about finding vulnerabilities; the dynamic and transparent nature of engagements with our carefully selected pentesters provides invaluable insights and learning opportunities for security teams; strengthening your application security and validating your fixes.

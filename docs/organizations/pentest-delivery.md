HackerOne has redefined [traditional pentesting](https://www.hackerone.com/penetration-testing/youre-doing-pentesting-wrong) with **Pentest as a Service (PTaaS)**, offering vetted expertise, quick results, and interactive feedback. It ensures compliance and encourages direct collaboration between security teams and pentesters.

The PTaaS approach goes beyond just finding vulnerabilities. Engaging with our selected pentesters offers valuable insights and learning opportunities for security teams, enhancing application security and validating fixes.

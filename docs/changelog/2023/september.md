### Explicit Content Filter
We've noticed more customers seeking help with testing machine learning models, including generative AI and content moderation. Some of these models can generate or misclassify explicit content, creating vulnerabilities that may require manual review.
To boost safety, we've developed a solution that automatically detects explicit content in user-uploaded images. When found, these attachments are hidden and blurred by default, requiring users to opt-in to view them. This strengthens our commitment to supporting AI model testing, with potential video support in the future.
